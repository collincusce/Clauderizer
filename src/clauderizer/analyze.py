"""The analyze gate (D-016/D-018): surface the existing invariants/decisions most
relevant to a piece of text — and the one-hop graph neighbors it touches but has
not connected — for the AGENT to judge contradiction, supersession, or a gap.

Judgment-based, exactly like ``cz_cascade``: the engine ASSEMBLES candidates and
prompts; it never decides. Relevance is keyword + entity-id overlap (O-01:
dependency-light, no embeddings — L-14), ranked and capped so the agent sees the
right few, not the whole file. The gap-finder is the structural complement
(D-018): it walks the project graph's own edges one hop out from what the text
already names, so "related but unconnected" needs no embeddings either.
