# Chat Handoff Index — Context Economics

> Last updated: 2026-06-09
> Status: Phase 0 ready

## How This Works

This is the coordination point for sessions executing this gameplan. A fresh
session gets current state automatically from the Clauderizer SessionStart hook,
then calls `cz_next_phase_context` for the active phase. No manual reading order.

## Pre-Flight Verification

Run `cz_preflight` before any code. If any enabled check fails: STOP, report.

**Current baseline test count**: 0

## Ending Protocol

1. Update PHASE-STATUS.md (status + outputs + corrections).
2. `cz_add_lesson` for anything new.
3. `cz_transition_status` on touched entities (fires cascade).
4. `cz_write_handoff` for the next phase.
5. Run exit verification; report the test count.
